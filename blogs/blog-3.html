      <p>A lot of sceptics think whether time travel is possible or its just another sci-fi fiction. So, this is my thought about the same</p>

      <p>Firstly, I would like to make some note that are quite important for the readers to know:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Conservation of mass</strong>: The states that in a closed or isolated system, matter cannot be created or destroyed. It can change forms but is conserved.</li>
        <li><strong>Conservation of energy</strong>: The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Lets assume that time travel were possible and one could travel back and forth in time. You sit in the time machine excited to go to lets say the year 2100. You press the button and swoosh…! You managed to travel forth in time but here’s the problem.</p>

      <p>When you traveled from 2024 to 2100 you had some mass…i.e. the then space time had some net mass say ‘x’ and energy ‘y’ but when you left that space time your mass got reduced from the then universe to say ‘x minus your mass’ along with the energy used to travel in time as well say ‘y minus something’. As a result the total net mass and energy of the then universe reduced…which would violate the conservation of mass and energy becuz the mass and energy of a system should remain constant.</p>

      <p>This seemed to me quite plausible…. but it is a bit flawed</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I considered time to be a different ‘region’ as if we can move through via a car or something? Well, the thing is we aren’t sure if thats the case</li>
        <li>I didn’t consider the fact that the mass decreases as we approach faster speed.</li>
        <li>Moreover we haven’t taken into account ‘dark energy’… well it is just in theory at the moment but it needs to be considered… becuz of which we can’t even say if the universe has a constant ammount of mass and energy either.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Thus, we got back to the point where we started without any conclusion…So, time travel seems to be a fascination at present but maybe it would be possible in future… or maybe it’s just another chimera.</p>
